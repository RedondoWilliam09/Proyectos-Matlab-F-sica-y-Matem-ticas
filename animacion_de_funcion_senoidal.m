% Line Animations
% This example shows how to create an animation of two growing lines. The |animatedline| 
% function helps you to optimize line animations. It allows you to add new points 
% tmated lines of different colors. Then, add points to the lines 
% in a loop. Set the axis limits before the loop so that to avoid recalculating 
% the limits each time through the loop. Use a <docid:matlab_ref.f56-719157 docid:matlab_ref.f56-719157> 
% or |drawnow limitrate| command to display the updates on the screen after adding 
% the new points.

a1 = animatedline('Color',[0 .7 .7]);
a2 = animatedline('Color',[0 .5 .5]);

axis([0 20 -1 1])
x = linspace(0,20,10000);
for k = 1:length(x);
    % first line
    xk = x(k);
    ysin = sin(xk);
    addpoints(a1,xk,ysin);
    
    % second line
    ycos = cos(xk);
    addpoints(a2,xk,ycos);
    
    % update screen
    drawnow limitrate
end

% The animation shows two lines that grow as they accumulate data.
%% Query Points of Line
% Query the points of the first animated line.

[x,y] = getpoints(a1);
%% 
% |x| and |y| are vectors that contain the values defining the points of 
% the sine wave.
